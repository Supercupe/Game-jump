# Game-Project

This project handles simple authorization and game mechanics.<br>

I built a local server with options to register, log in, or play as a guest. If you choose to register or log in, you can track your high score.<br>

## Technologies Used<br>

- PostgreSQL for database management<br>
- JavaScript for route handling and middleware<br>
- Express.js for server-side logic<br>
- Bcrypt for simple encryption<br>
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end game<br>

## Game Description<br>

I created a simple jumping game using HTML, CSS animations, and JavaScript. The game was inspired by a YouTube tutorial:  <br>
